    "#  Why Python?\n",
    "Python has emerged over the last couple decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets. This may have come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind. The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: NumPy for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, Pandas for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, SciPy for common scientific computing tasks, Matplotlib for publication-quality visualizations, IPython for interactive execution and sharing of code, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and many more tools that will be mentioned in the following pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a guide to the Python language itself, I would suggest a book, \"A Whirlwind Tour of the Python Language\". This short report provides a tour of the essential features of the Python language, aimed at data scientists who already are familiar with one or more other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Python 2 vs Python 3\n",
    "In this course, we will uses the syntax of Python 3, which contains language enhancements that are not compatible with the 2.x series of Python. Though Python 3.0 was first released in 2008, adoption has been relatively slow, particularly in the scientific and web development communities. This is primarily because it took some time for many of the essential third-party packages and toolkits to be made compatible with the new language internals. Since early 2014, however, stable releases of the most important tools in the data science ecosystem have been fully compatible with both Python 2 and 3, and so this course will use the newer Python 3 syntax. \n",

    "# To Write Python codes, we need the following\n",
    "1. **An editor**: Such as Windows NodePad, GEdit, Sublime, Spyder, PyCharm, etc, basically any text editor will do;\n",
    "2. **An intepreter**: Python is an interpreted language, which is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. Python has different version of intepreters such as Cpython (default), Jpython, Ironpython, etc;\n",
    "3. **Packages**: One of the most important advantage of Python is its packages system,it includes more than 10000 different packages up to now. Packages are like function libraries that are implemented by the others and can be used easily in your codes to do something specific. It is very easy to use packages in Python, just a simple \"import xxx\" will do the work. We will learn \"Numpy\", \"Pandas\", \"Scikit_learn\" and other packages that are closely related to data science in this course.\n",
    "4. Package manager: software that manage the packages, install, upgrade or delete them. Such as Pip, conda, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we can use different products above in combination. Or, much easier for beginners, we can use a integrated solution such as \"jupyter notebook\" where we can write, run, debug and learn python programming in one place."

    "# 1. How to use juypter notebook to write codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is one of the front end of Anaconda python development environment. There are two fairly prominent terms that you should notice, which are probably new to you: **cells** and **kernels** are key both to understanding Jupyter and to what makes it more than just a word processor. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **kernel** is a “computational engine” that executes the code contained in a notebook document.\n",
    "- A **cell** is a container for text to be displayed in the notebook or code to be executed by the notebook’s kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind every notebook runs a kernel. When you run a code cell, that code is executed within the kernel and any output is returned back to the cell to be displayed. The kernel’s state persists over time and between cells — it pertains to the document as a whole and not individual cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you import libraries or declare variables in one cell, they will be available in another. In this way, you can think of a notebook document as being somewhat comparable to a script file, except that it is multimedia. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever wish to reset things, there are several incredibly useful options from the Kernel menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Restart**: restarts the kernel, thus clearing all the variables etc that were defined.\n",
    "- **Restart & Clear Output**: same as above but will also wipe the output displayed below your code cells.\n",
    "- **Restart & Run All**: same as above but will also run all your cells in order from first to last.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your kernel is ever stuck on a computation and you wish to stop it, you can choose the Interupt option.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cell**: The jupyter notebook are files ended with *.ipynb*. Inside the file, each notebook consists a bunch of Cells. Cells are just blocks of texts in Markdown formats or codes.\n",
    " -  Code cells allow you to enter and run code. Run a code cell using ``Shift-Enter``.\n",
    " -  Markdown cells can contain text. You can change the cell type to Markdown by using the Cell menu, the toolbar, or the key shortcut *m* (in command mode, use key shortcut *y* to change from Markdown to code cell type). \n",
    "     - *Markdown is a popular markup language that is a superset of HTML. For markdown tips, refer to [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mode of cell**: a cell has two possible status, **Command** mode and **Edit** mode\n",
    "    - When a cell is in a **blue rectangle frame**, it is in **\"Command\"** mode, it means you can edit the cell as a whole, for example, you can copy, paste, delete, merge, insert cells in this status, using the menu in jupyter notebook interface, or with keyboard shortcuts. To enter the **Command** mode press **ESC** or click anywhere outside the cell. Here are some frequently used shortcuts for editing cells as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "> c(copy), x(cut), v(paste), dd(delete), a(insert before), b(insert after), o(dislay/hide output), l(line number), shift+m(merge)\n",
    "    \n",
    "   - When a cell is in a **green rectangle frame**, it is in the **\"Edit\"** mode, it means you can edit the content of the cell.You can enter this mode by pressing ``enter`` or clicking the mouse on a cell editor area. Here are some frequently used shortcuts for running and editing code cells.\n",
    "    \n",
